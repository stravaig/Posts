# Borders 350 - 2021 Group Start

Been home for a day now and have pretty much recovered from the route. Had an amazing 4 day adventure - thanks for organising again Ray. In contrast to last year, weather conditions and my fitness were about as good I could have hoped for, day 1 was still pretty tough though. Thought the new start was a big improvement, making the route over to Marys Loch 100% ridable. 

Donald and i were riding at a similar speed, so we crossed paths often on St Marys Loch, and Dollar Law. I had a slightly longer break in Broughton so that was where we parted ways. The hike-a-bike up to the windfarm was brutal in the heat (my head unit was reading 28Â°C!) but the descent was great fun. I was glad to have the Devil Beeftub hike-a-bike back in, as having read other riders blogs is seems to be a big part of the routes character. At one point I spotted Donald cresting a hill top ahead, but only briefly then he disappeared again. I won't say I enjoyed it (that would be crazy), but descent into the Beef Tub was definitely worth it - very exposed route with great atmosphere at an landmark of the Borders. The "bad step" was fine, but then I do come from a climbing background and my bike wasn't too heavy. The lower section was fairly overgrown with ferns which made navigation tricky. Rolled in Moffat at around 2045 - just in time for a much need takeaway pizza. Resupplied at the co-op before finding a bivvy spot just outside the town.

Was up at 4am on Day 2, finally starting riding at 5am (need to work in my camping efficiency!). Met Donald around 6am as he was just packing up his bike. Stopped and chatted until he was ready then we rode off together. We eventually became separated on the South Upland Way hike-a-bike section and I didn't see him again all day. Not much to say about his section - fast forest gravel tracks a welcome change from yesterday, but less interesting views. Had a wee tumble at one point got a bit of a gash on my elbow. I was struggling with appetite and eating on the bike, so decide the change my plan slightly and have one long break a day with a proper meal. So I stopped in Newcastleton for an hour. I have never been to a trail centre before, so the route change leaving Newcastleton was certainly exciting. Not sure a drop bar, rigid bike with 9kg of gear and aerobars is a standard set up, but I survived the red run ðŸ˜ƒ.

I reached Spithope Bothy at around 2045 and decided to stop there. I watched Donald on the tracker heading up the track and thought he'd be joining me in the Bothy, but he seemed to keep going up into the ridge. 

I left the Bothy at about 0430 the next morning. It had been raining overnight, so my choice of staying in the Bothy rather than the bivvy bag seemed like the right one. Caught Donald up again at around 0530. Had a brief chat before leaving him to pack up his camp on the ridge. Thankfully, and in contrast to last year, the ridge to the crossroads was entirely ridable. Met the Pete and Colin at the refuge, which apparently was full last night, so I was pleased with my decision to stop at Spithope. The section after cross roads was a lot tougher, frequently having to get off to cross very boggy ground. After struggling along for a while I happened to glance to my right, and spotted, through the mist, just beyond the fence line, the paved path of the Pennine Way. Damn! Hopped over the fence, and after that everything was much easier going. 

Decided to stop at Wooler for my daily refuel. This was perhaps a bit of a mistake. What with having to leave the route to get to the town, and then climbing back up the hill to the route, I lost about 2 hours. Looking at the tracker I saw that Donald, who choose not to stop at Wooler, had past me. From our earlier chats, I don't think Donald was looking at the tracker. As fatigue started to set in a 'racing' mentality was becoming rather important to maintaining my motivation. Bit silly, especially when the other person isn't thinking that way, but there it is. So I spent the rest of the day trying, and failing to catch up again with Donald. I was feeling pretty fatigued today, so found this bit harder going than the terrain probably should have been. Ended up stopping for the night at around 2230 at the base of the Borders Ridge, ready to head up 'The Street' morning morning and hopefully making it to Peebles. I had no mobile signal so had no idea how far ahead Donald was. 

Got up at 3am, setting off at 0345 to start a slow plode up the ridge in the dark. I past Donalds tent at about 5am on the descent into Scotland. No big stops planned today, in the hope of getting to Peebles at a descent time. Got to Jedburgh at 7am, quick stop to drop rubbish and grab a morning roll (ðŸ‘Œ) then back on the bike. Took another 20 minutes in Hawick to grab lunch. Leaving Hawick I realised I'd forgotten to refill my water. Damn! Looking at the tracker I could see that Donald had also just arrived in Hawick - the guy never seemed to rest! Another stop in Selkirk for water, then up to the Three Brethren. I thought this section over to Innerleithin was a real high point of the route. Beautiful hills and tracks.

The Innerleithin trail centre was fun, although I think the addition of a black run (even with the escape routes) was a bit much for my tired and inexperienced body. Maybe that says more about me than the route.

The last climb was slow. Was pretty much done in and, confident that Donald couldn't catch me now, I'd lost the drive from a mental/pretend race. I walked nearly the whole way. Coasted down the final descent, crossing the gate onto the tarmac at 1715. Snapped a couple of selfies, then rode off to meet my wife and kids at a  play park in Peebles - thankfully I'd arrived in time for a lift back to Edinburgh!
